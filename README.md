* Fast system sort implementation using a **bitmap** data structure along with an efficient algorithm for 
sampling `k` unique elements in range `[1, n]`. The problem is to design an efficient algorithm to sort a list of 
`1,000,000` distinct positive elements all lesser than `10,000,000` using lesser than `2 MB` storage. The sorting 
algorithm designed here beats the Java system sort by a factor of `4`.
